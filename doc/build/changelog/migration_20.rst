What's New in SQLAlchemy 2.0
=============================

.. admonition:: About this Document

    This document describes SQLAlchemy 2.0, which represents a major reworking
    of API and usage paradigms from the 1.x series.   Moving from a 1.x
    SQLAlchemy application to 2.0 requires migration to new 2.0-style paradigms,
    most of which are available in the 1.x series for future compatibility.
